# Neutrino-Event-Classification-with-ML

**Project:** Classifying neutrinos using CNN in a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment

**Abstract:** Using a machine learning model to classify neutrinos improves the speed and
 accuracy with which their properties and behaviours can be analysed, helping to obtain
 a deeper understanding of neutrinos. This project delves into various applications of a
 Multi-View Convolutional Neural Network in a neutrino oscillation experiment, using data
 similar to the NoVA experiment. The performance of the algorithm was tested on DIS and
 QE events, as well as low and high energy neutrinos and muons (accuracy: 0.85, F1 score:
 0.80). Extended investigations into neutrino energy (MAE: 6.23) and flavour (accuracy:
 0.894) yielded satisfactory results.
